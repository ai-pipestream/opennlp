# Parser CLI bracket benchmark

A minimal parser implementation returns the flat parse, keeping the timed path focused on `ParserTool.parseLine` preprocessing and token assembly.

Trial setup checks the flat parse and records its token count and a deterministic hash of the text,
token types, and spans. Corrected bracket handling may change this output; review those differences
before comparing timings. Long lines include the cost of constructing the public Parse result,
which can dominate bracket separation. These scores do not isolate the bracket scanner.

Build and materialize the test classpath:

```bash
./mvnw test-compile -Pjmh -pl opennlp-core/opennlp-cli -am \
    -Dopennlp.forkCount=1 -Drat.skip=true
./mvnw dependency:build-classpath -Pjmh -pl opennlp-core/opennlp-cli \
    -am -Dopennlp.forkCount=1 -Drat.skip=true \
    -DincludeScope=test -Dmdep.outputFile=/tmp/opennlp-jmh-cp.txt
CP="opennlp-core/opennlp-cli/target/classes:opennlp-core/opennlp-cli/target/test-classes:$(cat /tmp/opennlp-jmh-cp.txt)"
```

Smoke-test the harness:

```bash
java -cp "$CP" org.openjdk.jmh.Main 'ParserToolBracketBenchmark' \
    -f 1 -wi 0 -i 1 -r 100ms
```

To measure an implementation checkout without copying benchmark sources into its review diff,
build the same module in that checkout and prepend its `target/classes` directory to `CP`.
Classpath order selects the implementation while retaining the benchmark from this checkout.

For measurements, use at least two forks, warmup, several measurement iterations, and the allocation profiler. Save the raw output with the exact commit and JDK. Do not treat a smoke run as performance evidence.

Before measuring, prepend the checkout's built reactor class directories to the resolved dependency
classpath. This prevents an installed Maven SNAPSHOT from supplying the implementation being timed:

```bash
while IFS= read -r benchmark_pom; do
    benchmark_classes="${benchmark_pom%/pom.xml}/target/classes"
    if [ -d "$benchmark_classes" ]; then
        CP="$benchmark_classes:$CP"
    fi
done < <(git ls-files '**/pom.xml')
```

For a candidate overlay, repeat this step with absolute paths into the candidate checkout, after
adding its external dependencies. Record the actual loaded class origins, exact branch commit,
harness diff, JDK and raw JMH output. Build and measurement must not overlap with other work.
